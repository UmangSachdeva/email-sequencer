# Automated Email Sequencer

`Automated Email Sequencer` is a `MERN Stack` application designed to help users create and manage automated email campaigns using an interactive flowchart interface. The app leverages `React Flow` for visualizing workflows, `Agenda` for scheduling emails, and `Nodemailer` for sending them.

## Key Features

- **Flowchart-Based Design**: A user-friendly interface for designing email sequences.
- **Custom Node Types**:
  - **Lead-Source Node**: Specifies the email recipients.
  - **Cold-Email Node**: Represents individual emails with customizable subject lines and body content.
  - **Wait/Delay Node**: Inserts time intervals between emails.
- **Automated Scheduling**: Emails are scheduled and sent automatically based on the designed flowchart.
- **Modal Forms**: Simplified forms for adding or modifying nodes and their properties.
- **Backend Integration**: Transmits node and edge data to the backend to initiate the email sequence.
